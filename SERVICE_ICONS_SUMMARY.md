## 📋 Next Steps

### Option 1: Use Icons Immediately
You can now reference these icons in your service pages. Example usage:

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image';

<Image 
  src="/service-icons/administrative-support/service-icon.png" 
  alt="Administrative Support"
  width={400}
  height={400}
/>
```

### Option 2: Wait for "Hire Developers" Icon
The quota will reset in approximately 4.5 hours. I can generate the final icon then to complete the full set.

### Option 3: Manually Create "Hire Developers" Icon
You can use any design tool (Figma, Canva, etc.) to create a matching icon based on the style of the 15 generated icons.

## 🎨 Design Consistency

All icons maintain:
- **Color Palette**: Primary blue (#215ACD), light blue accents, yellow highlights
- **Style**: Modern flat illustration with clean vectors
- **Background**: White/transparent
- **Composition**: Central main element with 4-6 supporting elements
- **Professional**: Business-appropriate, no text overlays
